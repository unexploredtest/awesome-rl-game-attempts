In the file `src/attempts.json`, either update your entry or add a new entry for the new attempt. The schema is present in `src/attempts-schema.json`.

Note that the AI has to be an RL agent.

If a clone of the game is used instead of the original one, it should mimic the game very closely and it will receive a caveat.

Nice features that the attempt can have:
- No reliance on human data
- Open source and being easily repreducable
